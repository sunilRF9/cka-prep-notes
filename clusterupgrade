# K8s supports only 3 release versions at a time 
# ex: 1.13 is out then 1.10 will be out of support

# Steps
Upgrade Master to next minor version. Then same for workers.
Upgrade kubeadm first ```apt-get -y upgrade kubeadm=1.12.0-00```
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.00
next upgrade kubelet
```apt-get -y upgrade kubelet=1.12.0-00```
Same for workers

1.19.0 to 1.20.0

On the controlplane node, run the command run the following commands:

    apt-get update
    This will update the package lists from the software repository.

    apt-get install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
    This will install the kubeadm version 1.20

    kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.0
    This will upgrade kubernetes controlplane. Note that this can take a few minutes.

    apt install kubelet=1.20.0-00 This will update the kubelet with the version 1.20.

    You may need to restart kubelet after it has been upgraded.
    Run: systemctl restart kubelet

# Mistake 1
Forgot to run ```kubeadm upgrade apply v1.20.0```  after apt-get install kubeadm=1.20.0-00
